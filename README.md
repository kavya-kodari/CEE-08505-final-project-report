## 🏗️ 5. Infrastructure Vulnerability

| River          | Flow Variability | Peak Magnitude | Recovery Time | Vulnerability Score |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Delaware River | 0.85             | 9.82           | 0.86           | 3.87                 |
| Saddle River   | 1.63             | 27.12          | 0.37           | 10.90                |
| Raritan River  | 2.23             | 24.63          | 0.40           | 10.19                |

- **Flow variability** is the strongest predictor of infrastructure vulnerability.
- Model accuracy: **83%**, MAE: **0.14**, R²: **0.79**
